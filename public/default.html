				<h2 style="color: #007DCC"> What is ShipBro  </h2>
				<p>
						ShipBro is a web based unified messaging and networking system for maritime shipping business which allows the whole industry to be in touch with each other in a way with the <span style="background: yellow;">highest privacy and complete control over their own contacts.</span> We believe it is vital for maritime shipping business participator to protect their contacts from competitors.  We designed the whole system based on this main principle. 
You don’t share your contacts  but you communicate with your own contacts if you decide to <span style="background: yellow;">invite them to your contact list trough their email address </span> and after that it is up to you to let them see which users they can see in your contacts or you can ban their access to your contacts list altogether. 
Unlike the other professional social networks ShipBro is not aiming to connect people you don’t know or vice versa, althoug if you want you can. It is entirely under your control. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="span4">
				<h2 style="color: #007DCC"> At a Glance ShipBro  </h2>
				<p>
						We would like to introduce you a new way of communicating with your business partners and potential customers. ShipBro is a social networking platform with very high PRIVACY aiming to protect all your business relationships unlike all the other forms of social networks including LinkedIn. 
We have been working on a system which will let shipbrokers, ship owners, suppliers, bunkers and crew managers and all parts of maritime shipping businesses to be in contact with each other with the highest PRIVACY. It means you control all your contacts and data by inviting people  not  the other way around.
Highest PRIVACY is the key for almost all people in maritime shipping businesses. We are aware of that. You will be managing all your contacts yourself and your data, your identity and your messaging will never be accessible to any 3rd parties yet you will be enjoying all the benefits and advantages of a social network and collaboration environment. In time you may even replace your traditional email messaging system with ShipBro.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="span4">
				<h2 style="color: #007DCC"> Why shall we use the system?  </h2>
				<p>
						Shipbro is web based. You don’t have to carry your laptop with you. You can access the system on any computer with total protection. You don’t have to save unnecessary data on your servers or laptops. Whenever you need to change your laptop (planned or crashed) you won’t  lose any data.  It gives you an opportunity to create an inner circle among your customers. 
It is accessible with your mobile phone or Iphone or any kind of PDA.It allows you to be platform independent. 
It is a great alternative to your traditional email system. Definitely it creates a huge advantage by allowing you to access to your customers in case of email system breakdowns or outdated email systems to be upgraded to the new systems. 
It gives the upper management higher control of your accounts.

				<h2 style="color: #007DCC"> Who uses Shipbro ?  </h2>
				<p>
						It is for all parties involved in maritime shipping businesses.
We initially designed the website for shipbrokers but it offers great opportunities for all the aspects of maritime business .Give it a try and keep in touch with the industry.  
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="span4">
				<h2 style="color: #007DCC"> Who should stay away ?  </h2>
				<p>
						If you are not from the industry and you are spamming the users or you are using the system for only marketing purpose or access as many contacts as possible (which is impossible to do it without the users approval and it won’t be possible to search the user database) Shipbro is not for you. Before you know it your account will be closed. There are some great websites for professional networking . Our priority is to give the users highest privacy as if it is their internal email systems. So it won’t work for you.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="span4">
				<h2 style="color: #007DCC"> Why are we doing this ? </h2>
				<p>
						We believe in a very short period of time, email communication for businesses will be outdated, way too hard to maintain and also quite costly. It already is very costly but since the majority of the world is still relying on email communication everybody bears the cost. Email is a very complicated and messy system even though many of the users unaware of it. It is much safer to have a common system for all the industry parties that they can access to each other instantaneously. Think it is as stock exchange for maritime business.
It is a free system and we intend to keep it that way as long as we can.
